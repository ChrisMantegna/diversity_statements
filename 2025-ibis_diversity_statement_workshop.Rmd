# Welcome!

<div class="notes">
- Grounding, taking 2 seconds to get everyone to change gears into our space
- Some quick notes, today's conversation is a 'yes, and' conversation - not a 'yes, but' we're in the mindframe that we are honing skills, not debating the validity of those things

# What is a Diversity Statement?
<div class="notes">
- Ask for 
</div>

##
- Also known as a Perspectives or Experience Statement
- One of three statements in an application package
- Least clear and most misunderstood piece of the package
<div class="notes">
(we're going to take a look at why before we dive into details because context is crucial for crafting a solid statement)
</div>

## Timeline | Inception
- Around since early 2000s in the UC system
- Early 2010s Widely adopted by universities for faculty positions
- Mid 2010s Called into question by creating the false dichotomy of DEI v Merit- based hiring
- 2018 UC system made the statements mandatory for tenure-track position applications
<div class="notes">
Prior to the politicization of DEI, these statements existed
This is a normal part of a job application - 'is this candidate a good fit for our culture'
We didn't see the politicization until around the time of political rhetoric
It is important to note that all practices need to be interrogated - academic applications are no different, this is an iterative practice and unfortunately, the narrative was hijacked by folks outside of the academy and we move into a contentious era in the 2020s
</div>

## Timeline | Current
- 2020 Near complete adoption of the practice **allegedly** in response to the murder of George Floyd
- 2022 UW rejected making the statement a requirement for tenure-track applications
- 2023 Banned in public institutions in Texas, North Carolina and Missouri
- 2025 it is often a requirement in non-tenure track applications, often optional
<div class="notes">
Some insititutions were 'virtue signalling' by doubling down on their adoption  - but many were not.

(because it isn't a 'merit-based' metric)
</div>

## Purpose
- Academic search committees can gauge a candidate's 'fit' with the institution/ student body
- Documentation method to include the unpaid labor and often overlooked work of non-majority candidates

# So, *what* is it actually?

##
- Fundamental demonstration of your values, commitments and capabilities in an academic position
- Three areas of demonstration - the core of the academic position
  - Research
  - Teaching
  - Service
- Another opportunity to stand out

## {.flexbox .vcenter}

# What it is not

##
- Not about you 
  - Your identities 
  - Your privileges 
- Oppression Olympics
- Pie in the Sky, We are the World, pontification

<div class="notes">
- I know this seems counterintuitive, but ultimately this package is not about you but about how you translate the work
- Research statements are as much about your work as they are about your collaborations and how you've made the most of the opportunity
- Teaching are as much about your practice as it relates to how you've translated your philosophy to the students and if it is effective
- The DS is no different, it is not about you but rather how you use the tools you have or don't to connect to the MVV of the institution
</div>

# Why write one?

##
- Perfect opportunity to align your MVV with the institution
- Chance to expand on what you’ve already written in your teaching & research statements
- Demonstrates your understanding of ‘DEI’ beyond visible diversity
- How to thematically present yourself as a candidate by weaving your narrative across all 3 statements

# How to Write a Diversity Statement

## Preparation | Things You'll Need
1) Identify the institution’s MVV + the department/ committee’s perspective on that MVV ( I will provide one per table, make a few copies and pass them out)
2) Writing Tool/ Laptop
3) Your CV
**Note** - we're assuming we have the job description, did our research on the students, faculty, etc

## Process | Step 1: Institution's MVV
- What resonates?
- What's itchy?
- What feels genuine?
- What's aspirational?

## Process | Step 2: Reflection
This exercise is essentially creating a positionality statement - let's walk through how to do it

- Identity/ Privilege Wheel quick exercise
- Values + Teaching Philosophy Alignment
- What do you know about current research in pedagogy/ research/ student engagement?

## Process | Step 3: Run the Stats
- List SPECIFIC activities you’ve created/ participated in
- List SPECIFIC organizations you’ve created/ participated in
- List SPECIFIC teaching tactics/ strategies you’ve employed 
- List SPECIFIC research process accommodations/ protocols/ etc. that you’ve created

## Process | Step 4: Synthesis
- What is sticking out to you?
- Are you balanced across the 3 areas (research, teaching, service)
- How are you feeling emotionally? - not a pity party
- These next points can go to takeaways. 

## Process | Step 5: Drafting the Statement
- Framing here is key (you know you're strengths and weaknesses now, so play to your strengths)
- Reinforce how you and your work align with the institution’s MVV
- Hook your reader - personal anecdote
- Tell a cohesive story with specific examples

## {.flexbox .vcenter}

# Things to Keep in Mind

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- Oversharing your personal story - this is not about you, but what you can bring to the institution (remember that legally they cannot take into account your race/ ethnicity, faith, disability, any other protected status)
- Conversely, over-sanitizing your statement is a red flag (you cannot remove yourself from the process, don't try)
- Lack of specificity - theory is just an unpracticed thought in this regard
- False equivalencies - hyperbole and rhetoric are not useful tools here
- Self depreciation due to your privilege or trauma dumping
- Trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents - don't oversell or inflate your experiences

## Tips for Writing & Editing
- Remember: “Diversity statements are fundamentally about your values, commitments, and capabilities, and not necessarily your identities and the ways it shapes your work.”
- If you don’t have much experience, speak to where you will implement inclusive practices. Demonstrate what you’ve learned and how you can implement it. (this signals your understanding and shows a willingness to act)
- Limited experience does not make you a terrible educator, just a new one. (Don't let your beliefs around facts to supersede the facts themselves)
- Writing a positionality statement first (like we modeled, will make this whole process clearer and result in a clear statement)
- Storyboarding or concept mapping your package makes this easier to visualize
- Updating your CV before listing your in-statement examples to reflect your innovations in teaching/ mentoring (shoutout KPJ)
- Tailor it to the institution and position
- Don't waste space restating the pieces you've clearly discussed in your teaching and research statements
- Get another set of eyes on that joint! (preferably someone who has the position you want- leverage your upper-level network, peers are great but may lack the scope to really help)

# Wrapping it up

##
- Remember, it is not who you are, but what you can do
- Specificity, specificity, specificity!
- Connect this statement to your teaching and research statements for maximum impact
